Hello World.

Tech Stack:

- FFmpeg
- Node JS (look at [text](Video-PS/package.json)) for versioning and dependencies.

More on Node...

- V8 is locally downloaded and wrapped with C++ for CLI usage which Node leverages in it's scripts.
- Dev deps such as type script and it's types will not be used in production.
- Modules and dependencies are similar. We can also create these so long as they have exports.
- Package-lock is for the versioning of the dependencies.
- Node checks ~./zshrc cofig file for dependencies. All our deps need to be installed in our device for usage.
- If dependencies use npx, then if the dep isn't found, it is added to local cache for temp usage.
- Use npx for testing modules: npx jest --init for test framework.

Networking knowledge:
LEVELS OF NETWORKING

- Application
- Frameworks and bundlers which bundle all the public code into JS and deliver it as a response on the client side.
- We have our JS which is compiled by our local C++ wrapped V8 on the server side. These things run on our servers and hereâ€™s is where the logic happens including ML, and other middleware. (usually where containerization and orchestration of micro services is handled).
- Then we have express module which uses HTTP module from node to create an intuitive server API. (usually where big data and distributed system tech is handled).
- Then we have the HTTP module which uses the .net Node module which.
- Then we have the .net node module which is C++ for TCP networking written in C++.
- Then at the lowest level of software, we are working with the OS network stack and IP addresses.
- Hardware.

- Daemon: program which runs in the background (Cros, OS related C++ which express framework is built off of).

- Using curl for POST requests:
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/process-video \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"inputFilePath": "hello.MOV", "outputFilePath": "processed-hello.MOV"}'

More JS in Node context:

- Call back is the same as route handlers and are the function in the perameter of the other funtion.
- Not always async unless attatched with a promise or other callbacks.
- Passed into Node JS's single threded event loop.
